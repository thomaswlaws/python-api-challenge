OpenWeatherMap API
citipy Python package

APIs are very useful in gathering data for an analysis. Here, the OpenWeatherMap API was utilized to gather data to visualize some weather metrics against the latitude of a randomly generated list of 500+ cities. The following relationships are presented:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
A CSV file containing all data retrieved as well as PNG images for each plot created are also included.








Observable trends on WeatherPy
1.) There is not a strong relationship between cloudiness and latitude.
2.) The northern hemisphere is a little more windy in general than the southern hemisphere, with the wind speeds increasing slightly as the latitude increases.
3.) There is a slightly noticable increase in humidity as the latitude increases.
4.) In the southern hemisphere, wind speeds are the highest at the lowest levels of latitude.
